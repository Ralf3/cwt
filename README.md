continuous wavelet implementation in Julia

This is an test implementation to learn programming in Julia. Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic 
programming language with a easy to understand syntax. Julia includes a large mathematical library and is complement by a large number of packages. The best of Julia is that it can be used in an IJulia like Python in IPython. The just in time compiling makes it easy to get high calculation speed. 

The continuous wavelet transformation is sometimes useful to analyze time depended data like the Fourier transformation. But continuous wavelets can be used even when the frequency of the signal is not constant. I have implemented the real part of the wavelet functions in Julia.

I hope this piece of code is useful for some,

Ralf Wieland.
